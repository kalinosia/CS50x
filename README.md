# Week 1 C 

Letâ€™s recreate that pyramid in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, a la the below. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramid itself is also be taller than it is wide.

```bash
$ ./mario
Height: 8
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
```

```bash
$ ./mario
Height: -1
Height: 0
Height: 42
Height: 50
Height: 4
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```
