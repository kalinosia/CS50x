### Configuring
Before getting started on this assignment, we’ll need to register for an API key in order to be able to query IEX’s data. To do so, follow these steps:
* Visit iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/.
* Enter your email address and a password, and click “Create account”.
* On the next page, scroll down to choose the Start (free) plan.
* Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, sign in to iexcloud.io.
* Click API Tokens.
* Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with pk_).
